# LLM_Recommender
This project aims to develop a personalized book recommender system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)- powered Large-Language Models (LLMs) . The system will combine information retrieval and generation techniques to provide users with highly relevant book recommendations based on their interests and reading habits.
## Methodology:
This project will use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which combines a retrieval component with a generation model to enhance the relevance of recommendations. It involves several key stages: preparing the data, creating useful features, implementing the retrieval and generation components, creating similarity measures, collaborative filtering algorithm,  combining these components into a RAG system, and developing the platform.
